Welcome to the Bowl Of Sins aka _Paap ka Ghada_.
In this hangman influenced game, the goal is simple, to guess the word by guessing the characters of a word one at a time.

However, if you were unsuccessfull, the bowl of sins (or paap ka ghada) starts to fill up with your sins and after failing 7 times your soul becomes the property of Satan and you would be bound to him for all of the eternity.

Here we have three versions of the game :
1. The CLI version (Command Line Interface).
2. The GUI Version of the Hangman to increase the user-friendly experience.
3. The Last Version- the "THE MIGHTY BOWL OF SINS", where if you guess the wrong letter, your _paap ka ghada_ will start filling up and after 7 wrong chances, your soul will be trapped.
